Prepare to Install
//////////////////

The turboWAVE installer assumes Anaconda and the very latest C++ compilers and build tools are available.
Only the CMake build tool has any chance of succeeding as of this writing.
Because the build systems for C++20 modules are still evolving, it is best to look in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and see the comments regarding setting up your system.

As of this writing it is not recommended to try :doc:`install-easy`.
