Input File: Tools
=================

General Information
-------------------

TurboWAVE objects come in two flavors, Modules and Tools (not to be confused with post-processing tools).  Modules are the high level objects that orchestrate a simulation.  Tools (internally called ``ComputeTool`` objects) are lower level objects dedicated to specific computations. Tools are intended to be attached to one or more modules (modules can share the same tool).  Modules can be placed in a hierarchy.  Tools can only be attached to a module.

Tools are created like any object, see :doc:`ref-input`.

Many modules are able to create their tools automatically.  This page emphasizes those that tend to benefit from explicit management by the user.

.. _radiation:

Radiation Injection
-------------------

To inject radiation, you specify a type of electromagnetic mode, directives defining its particular parameters, and attach it to a field solver.  For an in depth description of the available radiation modes see :doc:`bak-em-modes`. If the wave starts inside the box, an elliptical solver may be used to refine the initial divergence. If the wave starts outside the box, it will be coupled in, provided the field solver supports this. Each wave object has its own basis vectors :math:`({\bf u},{\bf v},{\bf w})`, with :math:`{\bf u}` the electric field polarization direction and :math:`{\bf w}` the propagation direction. All the available modes respond to the same set of directives. These are as follows:

.. _wave-obj:
.. py:function:: new <key> [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	:param str key: The key determines the type of mode.  Valid keys are ``plane wave``, ``hermite gauss``, ``laguerre gauss``, ``bessel beam``, ``airy disc``, and ``multipole``.
	:param str module_name: Name given to a previously defined field solver module.
	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		.. py:function:: direction = ( nx , ny, nz )

			:param float nx: first component of :math:`{\bf w}` in standard basis.
			:param float ny: second component of :math:`{\bf w}` in standard basis.
			:param float nz: third component of :math:`{\bf w}` in standard basis.

		.. py:function:: a = ( ax , ay , az )

			If the peak vector potential is :math:`a_0`, then :math:`{\bf a} = a_0{\bf u}`.
			TurboWAVE will force transversality by making the replacement :math:`{\bf a} \rightarrow {\bf w}\times{\bf a}\times{\bf w}`

			:param float ax: first component of :math:`{\bf a}` in standard basis
			:param float ay: second component of :math:`{\bf a}` in standard basis
			:param float az: third component of :math:`{\bf a}` in standard basis

		.. py:function:: focus position = ( fx , fy , fz )

			:param float fx: first focal position coordinate in standard basis
			:param float fy: second focal position coordinate in standard basis
			:param float fz: third focal position coordinate in standard basis

		.. py:function:: w = w0

			:param float w0: central frequency of the wave

		.. py:function:: refractiveindex = n0

			:param float n0: refractive index in the starting medium

		.. py:function:: chirp = x

			:param float x: Multiply the amplitude by :math:`\exp (-i\chi t^2)`, with time referenced so that the center frequency occurs at the end of the risetime.  Up-chirp results from :math:`\chi>0`.  If you are trying to model the pulse from a grating compressor you may prefer to use a spectral phase.

		.. py:function:: spectral phase = { c2 , c3 , c4 , ... }

			Multiplies the pulse *spectrum* by :math:`\exp(i\varphi)`, where :math:`\varphi` is given by a Taylor expansion about the center frequency.  N.b. that applying this filter will change the pulse metrics.  Up-chirp results from :math:`c_2>0`.

			:param float cn: derivatives of the spectral phase, :math:`c_n = \partial^n_\omega \varphi(\omega)`.  Note that c0 and c1 are not used, since the effects would be redundant.

		.. py:function:: sample points = sp

			The number of points in the look-up table representing the pulse.  Use this to better resolve complex spectral phases, or if you need to resolve the rising part of a near top-hat profile.

			:param float sp: the number of sample points, defaults to 1024.

		.. py:function:: phase = p0

			:param float p0: phase shift in radians

		.. py:function:: delay = t0

			:param float t0: Front of wave reaches focus position after this amount of time

		.. py:function:: risetime = t1

		.. py:function:: holdtime = t2

		.. py:function:: falltime = t3

		.. py:function:: r0 = ( u0 , v0 )

			:param float u0: spot size at the vacuum waist in the :math:`{\bf u}` direction.  Note this is **not necessarily** the spot size in the first coordinate of the standard basis. Spot size is measured at :math:`1/e` point of the field amplitude.
			:param float v0: spot size in the :math:`{\bf v}` direction.

		.. py:function:: mode = ( mu , mv )

			Transverse mode numbers, different meanings depending on the mode type.

			:param int mu: mode number in the :math:`{\bf u}` direction
			:param int mv: mode number in the :math:`{\bf v}` direction

		.. py:function:: exponent = ( m , n )

			This directive applies only to the paraxial beam modes, Hermite and Laguerre.

			:param int m: exponent to use in transverse profile, default is 2 (standard Gaussian). If even induces order *m* supergaussian, if odd induces order *m+1* cosine.
			:param int n: If the mode is Hermite then *n* applies to the v-direction.  If it is Laguerre then *n* is ignored.

		.. py:function:: shape = pulse_shape

			:param enum pulse_shape: determines the shape of the pulse envelope, can be ``quintic`` (default), ``sin2``, ``sech``

		.. py:function:: boosted frame gamma = g

			:param float g: relativistic Lorentz factor of the boosted frame (default=1).  If g>1, turboWAVE will transform the wave into the boosted frame.  The parameters describing the wave should all be given in lab frame coordinates.  The grid coordinates are taken as the boosted frame.  At present this feature should only be used for paraxial modes propagating along the z-axis.

		.. py:function:: zones = z

			:param int z: create a superposition of transversely periodic modes across ``z`` zones in each dimension.  The number of zones should be odd, and large enough to span several spot sizes.  This is useful for boosted frame simulations where the Rayleigh length is much shorter than the pulse duration.

.. note::

	In the past there was a distinction between carrier resolved and enveloped radiation injection objects.  This distinction has been retired.  Envelope treatment is triggered automatically by attaching any radiation injection object to a enveloped field solver.

.. _matter-loading:

Matter Loading
--------------

The loading of matter into the simulation box is done using ``generate`` blocks.  These take the same form whether we are loading particles or fluid elements.  In loading matter it is important to distinguish the clipping region from the profile:

.. glossary::

	clipping region
		A clipping region is a filter that multiplies a physical quantity by zero outside the region, and unity inside.

	profile
		A profile is a spatial distribution of some intrinsic parameter such as density.

.. note::
	Our definition of thermal velocity is :math:`f(v) = f_0\exp(-v^2/2v_{th}^2)`

.. note::
	For isotropic distributions we have :math:`kT = mv_{th}^2`, :math:`v_i^{rms} = v_{th}`, and :math:`v_{tot}^{rms} = \sqrt{3}v_{th}`.

.. _matter-loading-shared:

When using a boosted frame the ``neutralize`` top level directive must be ``false``.

Particle Movers
----------------

Particle movers are used with ``Species`` modules.  As of this writing, there are no adjustable parameters.

.. sidebar:: terminology

	The term "mover" is used to encompass the field gather, momentum update, position update, and source scatter operations.  We reserve "pusher" for the momentum and position update.  Internally, mover objects are composed of slicers, pushers, and tilers.

There are three types of distinctions among mover tools:

	#. Physics - differing physics models can call for differing mover tools
	#. Dimensionality - optimization for an ignorable y-coordinate, or fully 3D
	#. Algorithm - different discretization schemes

The ``Species`` module will automatically choose a mover if none is specified.  It does this by looking at the grid, and the data that has been shared by other modules, and deducing the correct dimensionality and physics.  The way the discretization scheme is selected favors legacy methods, at present.

Boris Mover

.. py:function:: new boris mover [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	This is the long-standing, standard, relativistic, electromagnetic mover.  This is used by default if an electromagnetic field is detected, and there are no quantum or enveloped fields.

	There are no directives.

Bohmian Mover
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostics
------------

.. Note::

	If a diagnostic tool is not explicitly attached to any module, it will be automatically attached to all modules.  This is an optimization based on the observation that one would often like a similar type of output from all modules.

Diagnostic Formats
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TurboWAVE binaries are in numerical Python (numpy) format (extension ``.npy``). All metadata is in the file ``tw_metadata.json``. Text files are generally tab delimited tables of ASCII data, with a one-line header containing column labels.

.. highlight:: none

Box diagnostics produce a ``.npy`` file containing a four-dimensional array with axes (t,x,y,z).  Phase space diagnostics write a similar array, but the axes can have different meanings.  The grid data is found by looking up the ``'grid'`` key.  This returns a string with the name of the grid file containing the mesh point and time level information::

	t = <t0>
	axis1 = <x1> <x2> ... <xN>
	axis2 = <y1> <y2> ... <yN>
	axis3 = <z1> <z2> ... <zN>
	<...more frames>

For static grids, the additional frames only have the line giving the elapsed time.

The orbit diagnostic produces a ``.npy`` file containing the detailed particle information::

	Particle record 1 at time level 1
	Particle record 2 at time level 1
	...more particle records at time level 1
	Particle record N at time level 1
	Time level separator
	Particle record 1 at time level 2
	Particle record 2 at time level 2
	...more particle records at time level 2
	Particle record M at time level 2
	...more time level separators and particle records

Each particle record is an 8 element vector (x,px,y,py,z,pz,aux1,aux2).
The order of the particles within a time level is not significant.
Particles must be identified by unique values of aux1 and aux2.
The time level separator is a record with all zeros.
Valid particles can never have aux1 = aux2 = 0.

Example Post-processing Script
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. highlight:: python

Typical Python post-processing scripts begin like this::

	import numpy as np
	import json
	import pathlib

	my_path = pathlib.Path.home() / 'Run'
	# Get a field component into a 4D numpy array with shape (t,x,y,z)
	Ex = np.load(my_path / 'Ex.npy')
	# Load the metadata into a dictionary (all metadata)
	with open(my_path / 'tw_metadata.json','r') as f:
		meta = json.load(f)
	# As an example of metadata, get the conversion factor to mks units.
	# Note axis mapping, 0=t, 1=x, 2=y, 3=z, 4=data
	mks_factor = meta['Ex.npy']['axes']['4']['mks multiplier']
	# Get the name of the grid file
	grid_file_name = meta['Ex.npy']['grid']

The grid data is a text file.  One way to read it is with the following function::

	def get_mesh_pts(grid_file_path,dims):
	    """Try to find a grid warp file matching the npy file.
	    If the file is found return [tmesh,xmesh,ymesh,zmesh].
	    Each element is a list of the mesh points along the given axis.
	    If the file is not found return unit length uniform mesh.
	    Arguments: grid_file_path = pathlike, name of grid file.
	               dims = expected shape of the data"""
	    try:
	        ans = [[],[],[],[]]
	        with open(grid_file_path) as f:
	            for line in f:
	                l = line.split(' ')
	                if l[0]=='t':
	                    ans[0] += [float(l[-1])]
	                if l[0]=='axis1' and len(ans[1])==0:
	                    ans[1] = [float(x) for x in l[2:]]
	                if l[0]=='axis2' and len(ans[2])==0:
	                    ans[2] = [float(x) for x in l[2:]]
	                if l[0]=='axis3' and len(ans[3])==0:
	                    ans[3] = [float(x) for x in l[2:]]
	        if len(ans[0])==dims[0] and len(ans[1])==dims[1] and len(ans[2])==dims[2] and len(ans[3])==dims[3]:
	            return [np.array(ans[0]),np.array(ans[1]),np.array(ans[2]),np.array(ans[3])]
	        else:
	            warnings.warn('Grid file found but wrong dimensions ('+grid_file_path+').')
	            return [np.linspace(0.0,1.0,dims[i]) for i in range(4)]
	    except FileNotFoundError:
	        warnings.warn('No grid file found ('+grid_file_path+').')
	    except PermissionError:
	        warnings.warn('Ignoring grid file ('+grid_file_path+') due to permissions.')
	    return [np.linspace(0.0,1.0,dims[i]) for i in range(4)]

.. _diagnostics-shared:

Diagnostics Shared Directives
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following directives may be used with any diagnostic

.. py:function:: filename = f

	:param str f: name of the file to write. Actual file names may be prepended with the name of some subset of the overall data associated with the diagnostic (some diagnostics write multiple files).  This may be postpended with a filename extension such as ``.txt`` or ``.npy``.  The special name ``full`` causes the files to have only the prepended string and the extension in their names.  This is the default.

.. py:function:: clipping region = name

 	write data only within the specified geometric region.  See :doc:`ref-geometry` for documentation on creating complex geometric regions.  For some diagnostics there is a restriction on the complexity of the region.

	:param str name: the name of the geometric region to use

.. py:function:: t0 = start_time

	:param float start_time: time at which diagnostic write-out begins (default=0).

.. py:function:: t1 = stop_time

	:param float stop_time: time after which diagnostic write-out ends (default=infinity).

.. py:function:: period = steps

	:param int steps: number of simulation cycles between write-outs.

.. py:function:: time period = duration

	:param float duration: simulated time between write-outs, overrides ``period`` if specified.  If an adaptive time step is in use, this can approximate uniform spacing of write-outs.

.. py:function:: galilean velocity = (vx,vy,vz)

	Transform output to a Galilean frame, i.e., :math:`{\bf r}' = {\bf r} - {\bf v}t`.  This transformation can be combined with a boosted frame.

	:param float vx: x-component of the galilean transformation velocity
	:param float vy: y-component of the galilean transformation velocity
	:param float vz: z-component of the galilean transformation velocity

.. py:function:: boosted frame gamma = g

	:param float g: Lorentz factor associated with a boosted frame (default=1).  This is a request to unboost data generated in a boosted frame. As of this writing it is only implemented for orbit and phase space diagnostics, and there are some limitations (see below).

.. _specific-diagnostics:

Specific Diagnostics
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. py:function:: new box diagnostic [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	Write out grid data as sequence of frames.  Clipping region must be a simple box.
	This diagnostic produces several files per module, by default.

	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		Shared directives: see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`

		.. py:function:: average = tst

			:param bool tst: average over sub-grid, or not.  If not, diagnose lower corner cell only.

		.. py:function:: skip = ( sx , sy , sz )

			Defines a reduced grid produced by downsampling the full grid.  The reduction factor is the product of the three skipping parameters.  Note the centroid of the sampling points is shifted.

			:param int sx: advance this many cells in the x-direction between writes
			:param int sy: advance this many cells in the y-direction between writes
			:param int sz: advance this many cells in the z-direction between writes

		.. py:function:: reports = { <fields> }

			:param list fields: Put a list of fields to get restricted output.  If omitted then all available fields are written.


.. py:function:: new energy diagnostic [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	Diagnostic of volume integrated quantities.  Normalization includes the unit of particle number.

	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		Shared directives: see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`

		.. py:function:: precision = digits

		 	:param int digits: number of digits used to represent each result


.. py:function:: new point diagnostic [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	Diagnostic to write out grid data at a specific point.

	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		Shared directives: see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`

		.. py:function:: point = (Px,Py,Pz)

			Coordinates of the point to diagnose.  This is subject to the Galilean transformation (see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`).

.. py:function:: new phase space diagnostic [<name>] [for <module_name>] { <directives> }

	Diagnostic to write out up to 3D phase space projections.  Setting a dimension to 1 produces a lower dimensional projection.  The ``boosted frame gamma`` parameter can be used to put the data in the lab frame.  It is important to note that if this is done, the frame write-out index still slices time in the boosted frame.  On the other hand, explicit time axes are properly transformed.

	:param str species_name: the name of the species to diagnose
	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		Shared directives: see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`

		.. py:function:: axes = (ax1,ax2,ax3)

			Determines the axes of the phase space.  Axes can be any of ``t``, ``x``, ``y``, ``z``, ``mass``, ``px``, ``py``, ``pz``, ``g``, ``gbx``, ``gby``, ``gbz``.  If a dimension collapses to 1, the axis is ignored, but still must be specified.

			:param enum ax1: the phase space variable to associate with axis 1
			:param enum ax2: the phase space variable to associate with axis 2
			:param enum ax3: the phase space variable to associate with axis 3

		.. py:function:: dimensions = (N1,N2,N3)

			:param int N1: cells along axis 1
			:param int N2: cells along axis 2
			:param int N3: cells along axis 3

		.. py:function:: bounds = (x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1)

			Boundaries of the interrogation region.  In boosted frame simulations, these can be specified in the lab frame by setting ``boosted frame gamma``.

			:param float x0: lower bound for axis 1
			:param float x1: upper bound for axis 1
			:param float y0: lower bound for axis 2
			:param float y1: upper bound for axis 2
			:param float z0: lower bound for axis 3
			:param float z1: upper bound for axis 3

		.. py:function:: accumulate = acc

			:param bool acc: if true the phase space data accumulates, otherwise write-out frames are resolved (default=false).  This is especially useful for boosted frames.


.. py:function:: new orbit diagnostic [<name>] [for <module_name>]

	Diagnostic to write out full phase space data of the particles.  In boosted frame simulations, data can be put in the lab frame by setting ``boosted frame gamma``.  Note however that the time separators in the data file lose their meaning in this case.

	.. caution::
		Orbit diagnostics can create excessively large files if not used carefully.  To avoid this, define a species with a small number of test particles and use this on them.

	:param str species_name: the name of the species to diagnose
	:param block directives: The following directives are supported:

		Shared directives: see :ref:`diagnostics-shared`

		.. py:function:: minimum gamma = gmin

			:param float gmin: only save data for particles with gamma greater than this.  In boosted frame simulations, this can be specified in the lab frame by setting ``boosted frame gamma``.
