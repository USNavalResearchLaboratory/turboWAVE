# TurboWAVE Integration Tests

The integration tests should all be kept in this directory.
The internal structure of the directory is significant.
The test runner is the `twtest` python script maintained in root/tools.
There are two other kinds of tests that exist elsewhere:

1. Unit tests, see root/core/source/test
2. Sea trials, see root/core/examples
